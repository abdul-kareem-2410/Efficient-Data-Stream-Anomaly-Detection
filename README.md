This tool can be applied in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and IoT systems where real-time data processing is essential.

## Features

- Real-time anomaly detection in data streams
- Supports various data formats
- Configurable thresholds for sensitivity
- Visualization of detected anomalies
- Detailed logging for analysis

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/abdul-kareem-2410/Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection.git

**2. Navigate to the project directory:**

  cd Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection
  
**3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
  python -m venv venv
  
**4. Activate the virtual environment:**
  venv\Scripts\activate

 **5. Install the required packages:**
  pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**
To run the anomaly detection algorithm, execute the following command:
  python anomaly_detection.py
  
You may need to adjust the input data parameters according to your specific use case.
